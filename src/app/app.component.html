        The character is allowed ten regular objects, plus five in a
        backpack, sack or similar container. Heavy objects count
        as two, while minor objects count as half. Coins, gems and
        very small things are no-size items—100 of them count as
        one regular object. Use common sense to settle what is
        what. Weapons have regular/heavy/minor designators.
        Armors, unless magickal, count as per AC
